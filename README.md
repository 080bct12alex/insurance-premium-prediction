# 🚀 Building a Machine Learning-Powered API with FastAPI, Docker & AWS EC2

This project showcases the end-to-end process of:

- 🧠 **Building a machine learning model** (Random Forest) for insurance premium prediction  
- 🧩 **Integrating the model into a FastAPI backend** to expose prediction APIs  
- 🐳 **Containerizing the application using Docker** for portability and consistency  
- ☁️ **Deploying the service on AWS EC2** to make it globally accessible

It is part of my learning journey in deploying production-ready ML systems using modern backend frameworks and cloud infrastructure.
